// This file will be populated automatically with variables:
//  * cachePrefix: prefix that is always present in cacheName,
//    identifying the application even if multiple applications
//    are using the same origin (and thus can see each other's
//    cache).
//  * cacheName: the name to use for the cache
//  * cacheFiles: list of strings representing the files to cache
//
// Changes to this file will trigger a service worker update,
// so application updates will cause the worker to update and cache
// new data even if the service worker itself is unchanged.
